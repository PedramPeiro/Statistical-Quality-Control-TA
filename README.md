# Statistical-Quality-Control-TA
As a Teaching Assisstant at Amirkabir University of Technology, I teach Python to Students in this course. This teaching includes 3 parts:
1. Tutorial
2. Problem Solving
3. Assignments

## Tutorial:
My cooperation in this parts is only limited to the first 2 tutorials and I haven't finished the rest yet.

## Problem Solving
This part is made up of previous semester's exercises which I explain their solution in videos for better understanding. This way students learn more and engage more. Also they'll have more questions to solve.

## Assignments
These are the assignments related to python syntax, basic statistical analysis, plotting control charts, and CLT Theorem demonstration (my favorite part). As students may have access to the answers, it is not possible to upload the answers.
